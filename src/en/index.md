idea:
    title: "The Idea"
    des: "It's about providing citizens with a safe and private place for data points, the sovereignty of which is completely in their hands. This inventory continues to grow with each use and can be used to automatically fill out forms. In addition, the app acts like an agent that is constantly looking for new opportunities for citizens without ever revealing any data. This works by downloading queries that run on your own data and, for example, check eligibility for specific funding. Results remain local. Appropriate information comes to you instead of having to search for it. The third aspect is to provide support with planning: for example, to compare different scenarios of joint parental leave planning."
